Welcome to the Arithmetic Parser!

You can enter mathematical expressions and get them computed.
For example:
1 + 1
2*6+3
2(3+5)
2^(1/ln(5))

============================================================
Rules of expressions writing:

Command line options are case-insensitive. Expressions are case-sensitive.

Decimal delimiter is the dot character ".", for example "3.5".

Comma character is operator for arguments listing, for example "log(1.2, 4.6)".

Trigonometric functions expect input in radians.

Reserved symbol constants - PI, e.

NOTICE:
*If you run ArithmeticParser from Windows console, use double caret symbol for power operator, for example: "2^^3".

*Multiplication operators with modulus brackets '|' cannot be implicit and must be specified explicitly. In other case there could be disambiguations, for example the value of the
expression '|-3|-5|-2|' can be calculated as -7 or 17.

============================================================
Command line options:

-h
--help
Help: Give usage message and exit.

-v
--version
Version: Show program version and exit.

-e
--expression
Expression: Expression to calculate. If expression contains whitespace, it must be concluded in double quotes.
This is default option, if no options are supplied. Can be omitted.

-c
--clipboard
Clipboard: Copy the calculated value of the expression to the clipboard.

-f <fileName>
--file <fileName>
File: Specifies the file to load expression from.

-s <fileName>
-save <fileName>
Save: Specifies the file to write the calculations result.

-r
--verbose
Verbose: detailed output while parsing.

============================================================
Supported built-in functions:
	base arithmetic operators +-*/
	power operator - x^y or x^(y+z)
	absolute value - |x|
	sinus - sin(x)
	cosine - cos(x)
	arcsinus - asin(x)
	arccosine - acos(x)
	tangent - tg(x)
	cotangent - ctg(x)
	arctangent - atg(x)
	arccotangent - actg(x)
	natural logarithm - ln(x)
	decimal logarithm - lg(x)
	logarithm with the arbitrary base - log(value, base)

============================================================
Variables
Variables names can contain and numbers. Variable name cannot start with a number.
Reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable name are constant and builtin function names:
	PI, e, log, sin, cos, tg, ctg, asin, acos,  ln, lg.
